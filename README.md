#CAS Number Python Database Project


##Overview

This project provides a database of Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) numbers and their associated chemical names, formulas, and properties. The database is implemented in Python and uses SQLite as the backend to store the information.

The goal of this project is to provide a simple and intuitive interface for searching and retrieving information about chemicals based on their CAS numbers.
